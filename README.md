# Little Less Protocol for Python

Little Less Protocol is a simple serial protocol for little microcontrollers using less memory than the most other protocols.
Of course this implementation is for the PC side communication with such a microcontroller
therefore for this implementation saving memory is not so important as for the microcontroller side.

You can find the documentation about Little Less Protocol within the
[Little Less Protocol Suite](https://github.com/FraMuCoder/LittleLessProtocolSuite).
